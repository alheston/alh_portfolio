## Use Case
This ETL pipeline is designed to extract weather data from the Tomorrow.io API, transform the data into a structured format, and load it into a PostgreSQL database. The pipeline is scheduled to run hourly, ensuring the latest weather data is available for analytics and reporting.

The pipeline supports the following functionalities:
- Pulls hourly and daily weather data.
- Converts the JSON response into a pandas DataFrame.
- Upserts the transformed data into a PostgreSQL database, ensuring that only new or updated records are inserted.

## Tools Used / Architecture
- **Tomorrow.io API**: Provides weather data that includes hourly and daily forecasts.
- **Python**: The primary programming language used to build the ETL pipeline.
- **SQLAlchemy**: ORM used to interact with the PostgreSQL database.
- **PostgreSQL**: The database used to store the weather data.
- **Pandas**: Used for data manipulation and transformation.
- **Docker**: Used to containerize the ETL pipeline for deployment.
- **AWS ECS**: Orchestrates the running of the ETL Docker containers in a scalable manner.
- **Dagster**: Orchestrator used to manage the ETL pipeline and schedule tasks.

## How to Deploy into Production
1. **Dockerize the ETL Pipeline**:
   - Ensure the ETL script is production-ready.
   - Create a Dockerfile that installs all dependencies and sets up the environment.
   - Build and push the Docker image to your Docker registry (e.g., Amazon ECR).
  
2. **Set Up AWS Infrastructure**:
   - Create an ECS cluster if you don't already have one.
   - Define a task definition that references your Docker image.
   - Set up a service to run the task on a schedule (e.g., hourly).
   - Ensure that the necessary environment variables (e.g., API keys, database credentials) are set in the ECS task definition.
   - Set up logging and monitoring to track the performance and status of your tasks.

3. **Orchestrate with Dagster**:
   - Create a Dagster pipeline that defines the steps of your ETL process.
   - Deploy Dagster on the same VPC or instance as your ECS tasks to simplify configuration.
   - Schedule the pipeline to run at the desired frequency using Dagster's scheduling capabilities.
   - Monitor the pipeline runs from the Dagster UI and set up alerts for failures.

4. **Monitor and Scale**:
   - Use CloudWatch to monitor ECS task execution and set up alerts for any issues.
   - Scale the ECS service as needed based on the load and frequency of the ETL runs.

## How to Run Locally
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
